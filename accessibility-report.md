**Design Principles**

**1. Equitable Use:** Our program is accessible and marketable to users with different abilities, although some
knowledge in nutrition is required. For example, knowing the terms calories and different macronutrients is required
for making full use of the food logging functionality.

**2. Flexibility in Use:** Our program is flexible. For example, we open the selection to a wide range of weights and
heights for users at sign up. We could also improve our program in the future, such that it supports giving
recommendations based on height weight.

**3. Simple and Intuitive Use:** Our program is simple and intuitive to use because e have each option clearly
displayed. For example, the GUI is clear and easy to navigate because of its simplicity in design layout. The part that
might not be intuitive is installation, because our program would have to be installed from Github, and may not be
intuitive to download.

**4. Perceptible Information:** Our design communicates necessary information effectively in its minimalist GUI design.
For example, the food logging page has a progress bar for displaying information associated with daily recommended
values of consumption for calories and macronutrients, which gives a clear visual representation of the information.

**5. Tolerance for Error:** Our design has a high tolerance for error. For example, before a selection for food is made,
the user has to click a button to make the selection. Thus, it is less likely for the user to mis-select an option. 
Even if the user does make a mistake in selection, they could go back in history to delete it.

**6. Low Physical Effort:** Our program requires low physical effort. The only actions required by users are keyboard
entries and button clicks. No intensive physical interaction is needed with the program.

**7. Size and Space for Approach and Use:** Our program might not support people with certain disabilities such as
visual impairment. We could improve the program to include audio components.

**Marketing**

We could market our program to anyone who wants to have a healthy diet. Our program provides insight into what
percentage of the daily recommended value of calories and macronutrients that the user consumed. Thus, for anyone who
wants to have a healthy diet, the program is marketable. More generally, our program is marketable to anyone who wants
insight into their daily consumption or food, or simply have a record of their daily consumption.

**Demographics**

Our program is accessible to a diverse demographics. A group in particular that might be less likely to use our program
would be very young children. Usage of the app does require some knowledge of nutrition which very young children may
not have.
