Team User Story: Food logging

Josiah wishes to track the food he consumed in a day. He logs in to the nutrition tracker program and selects a day 
to input the food he consumed that day. The program calculates the amount of macronutrients, micronutrients, and 
calories he consumed that day. Basic shortfalls of the inputted food will be shown. For example, a calorie or 
micronutrient deficiency. A button is next to the shortfalls display that can take him to a page with food 
recommendations that bring his nutrient levels to what is expected. His input will be stored and available for him 
to view next time he logs in the program.

Use Cases:

User logs in:

    User enters username and password. The system shows the user is logged in if the username exists and the password
    matches the username. If the username does not exist or the password does not match the username, the system shows
    the log in failed.

User logs food:

    User enters the type and amount of food they consumed. The system shows the nutrients and calories the user
    consumed and stores the information if the entered food is valid. If the food entered is invalid, the system 
    alerts the user that no such food exists.

User logs out:

    User logs out and the system shows that the user successfully logged out.
